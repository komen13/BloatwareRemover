Known bugs
==========
* After clicking and swiping back and forth a few times onclick stops working but simply doing a long click works the same.
* Freezing Youtube on my nexus doesn't work. So there are probably other apps which are unfreezable as well. And to make matters worse it actually seems to ruin the apk.
* Showing two settings entries in the menu... neither does anything.
