Bloatware Remover
=================
This app lets you remove or freeze system apps.


Requirement
===========
In order for this app to work root access is required.


Features
========
* Delete system apps
* Freeze system apps
* Detect bloatware (comes with list of know bloatware)


Download
========
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snot.bloatware>


Known bugs
==========
* After clicking and swiping back and forth a few times onclick stops working but simply doing a long click works the same.
* Freezing Youtube on my nexus doesn't work. So there are probably other apps which are unfreezable as well. And to make matters worse it actually seems to ruin the apk.
